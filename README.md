This project aims to automate the analysis of CCTV footage from a Reolink camera system. Motion records are analysed using object detection. Detections search for people and triggers a notification when found.

Dramatically reducing the number of false positives that are created with a higher level of confidence. Automated overnight analysis even when at home. Analysis results stored in a MongoDB database with notifications sent with IFTT and slack. Object detections is carried out using the deepstack object detection API -Â [https://deepstack.cc/](https://deepstack.cc/)

## Criteria

What defines success for this project?

- Be able to detect people on property without human analysis
- Integrate with the Reolink camera system
- Reduce the number of false positive notifications
- Notifications are sent within short time of recording being saved
- Notifications have an image preview on mobile
- Ability to view video recording of person

## Problem

**One line:** Unaware of human activity on property unless sifting through all motion records 

The Reolink camera system is only able to detection motion based on the motion sensitivity of a certain area. It is unable to detect if this motion has been triggered by a human versus wind, rain or other objects such as pets/animals.

> Takes to much time to sift through video recordings when their are so many false positives. As a result recordings are not analysed unless aware of an incident either personally or via neighbours.

## Computer Vision:

In order to detect people in a video, computer vision analysis must be carried out in the form of **object detection**. Object detection models will be able to detect certain objects that they are trained on. The so called object that I am interested in this project is the "person" object.

By utilising object detection, the application will be able to understand with a certain degree of confidence if their is a person in a given frame. This is what is going to be used to reduce the number of false positive notifications.

In addition to object detection, other areas of custom computer vision models could be explored to provide an additional level of analysis such as face detection, detecting if a car open or closed.

## Notifications

Sending a notification in a timely manner is key for the success of this project. It is important that these notifications are able to provide as much detail to a user in a short period of time. In order to do this, the integration must be seamless and intuitive.

Notifications sent to mobile devices could be send using the **IFTTT** app which is able provide an image in addition to text in the notification without needing to open an app. This image will be key to providing insight regarding the person detection. In addition to this, **Slack** can be used to upload the full motion clip for full remote viewing. The correct slack channel can be open via the IFTTT
