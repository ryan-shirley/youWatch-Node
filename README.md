 This project aims to automate the analysis of CCTV footage from a Reolink camera system. Motion records are analysed using object detection. Detections search for people and triggers a notification when found.
 
Dramatically reducing the number of false positives that are created with a higher level of confidence. Automated overnight analysis even when at home. Analysis results stored in a MongoDB database with notifications sent with IFTT and slack. Object detections is carried out using the deepstack object detection API - https://deepstack.cc/
